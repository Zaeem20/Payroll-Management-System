The Maharashtra College Payroll Software is a simple Python application that allows users to calculate the salaries of their employees. The application is easy to use and has a user-friendly interface.

To use the application, simply open the `main.py` file and run it. The application will then open a window with two frames: the Banner frame and the Details section.

The Banner frame contains a banner image and a label that displays the application name.

The Details section contains four labels and four entry fields. The labels are used to identify the information that is entered into the entry fields. The entry fields are used to enter the employee's name, fixed pay, deduction, and working days.

Once the information has been entered, the user can click the Submit button to calculate the employee's salary. The salary will be displayed in a message box.

The application also has two radio buttons that allow the user to select whether the employee is a teaching or non-teaching employee. If the employee is a teaching employee, the application will display an additional label and entry field for the employee's visiting pay.

The application is written in Python and uses the Tkinter library for the user interface. The application is easy to use and can be easily modified to meet the needs of different users.

Here are the steps on how to use the Maharashtra College Payroll Software:

1. Open the `main.py` file in a text editor.
2. Run the file by clicking the Run button or by pressing `Ctrl`+`Enter`.
3. Enter the employee's name, fixed pay, deduction, and working days in the corresponding entry fields.
4. Select whether the employee is a teaching or non-teaching employee by clicking the appropriate radio button.
5. Click the Submit button to calculate the employee's salary.
6. The salary will be displayed in a message box.
